Elixirâ€™s processes should not be confused with operating system processes. 
Processes in Elixir are extremely lightweight in terms of memory and CPU (even compared to threads as used in many other programming languages). 

# spawn
spawn/1 takes a function which it will execute in another process.

    # returns a PID (process identifier)
    iex> pid = spawn(fn -> 1 + 2 end)
    #PID<0.43.0>
    
    # At this point, the process you spawned is very likely dead. 
    # The spawned process will execute the given function and exit after the function is done
    iex> Process.alive?(pid)
    false

We can retrieve the PID of the current process by calling self/0

    iex> self()
    #PID<0.41.0>
    iex> Process.alive?(self())
    true
