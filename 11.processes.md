Elixir’s processes should not be confused with operating system processes. 
Processes in Elixir are extremely lightweight in terms of memory and CPU (even compared to threads as used in many other programming languages). 

# spawn
spawn/1 takes a function which it will execute in another process.

    # returns a PID (process identifier)
    iex> pid = spawn(fn -> 1 + 2 end)
    #PID<0.43.0>
    
    # At this point, the process you spawned is very likely dead. 
    # The spawned process will execute the given function and exit after the function is done
    iex> Process.alive?(pid)
    false

We can retrieve the PID of the current process by calling self/0

    iex> self()
    #PID<0.41.0>
    iex> Process.alive?(self())
    true

# send and receive
send messages to a process with send/2 and receive them with receive/1:

    # When a message is sent to a process, the message is stored in the process mailbox.
    iex> send(self(), {:hello, "world"})
    {:hello, "world"}
    iex> receive do
    ...>   {:hello, msg} -> msg
    ...>   {:world, _msg} -> "won't match"
    ...> end
    "world"
  
 The process that sends the message does not block on send/2, it puts the message in the recipient’s mailbox and continues.
 The receive/1 block goes through the current process mailbox searching for a message that matches any of the given patterns.
 If there is no message in the mailbox matching any of the patterns, the current process will wait until a matching message arrives. 
 
     iex> receive do
    ...>   {:hello, msg}  -> msg
        # A timeout can also be specified
    ...> after
    ...>   1_000 -> "nothing after 1s"
    ...> end
    "nothing after 1s"
    
    iex> parent = self()
    #PID<0.41.0>
    iex> spawn(fn -> send(parent, {:hello, self()}) end)
    #PID<0.48.0>
    iex> receive do
    ...>   {:hello, pid} -> "Got hello from #{inspect pid}"
    ...> end
    "Got hello from #PID<0.48.0>"

While in the shell, you may find the helper flush/0 quite useful. It flushes and prints all the messages in the mailbox.

    iex> send(self(), :hello)
    :hello
    iex> flush()
    :hello
    :ok
