# Alias

    defmodule Stats do
      alias Math.List, as: List
      
      # Aliases are frequently used to define shortcuts. calling alias without an :as option
      # alias Math.List
      
      # In the remaining module definition List expands to Math.List.
    end
    
alias is lexically scoped, which allows you to set aliases inside specific functions

    defmodule Math do
      # the alias will be valid only inside the function plus/2. minus/2 won’t be affected at all
      def plus(a, b) do
        alias Math.List
        # ...
      end

      def minus(a, b) do
        # ...
      end
    end

An alias in Elixir is a capitalized identifier (like String, Keyword, etc) which is converted to an atom during compilation. 

    iex> is_atom(String)
    true
    iex> to_string(String)
    "Elixir.String"
    iex> :"Elixir.String" == String
    true
Aliases expand to atoms because in the Erlang VM (and consequently Elixir) modules are always represented by atoms:

    iex> List.flatten([1, [2], 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    iex> :"Elixir.List".flatten([1, [2], 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
That’s the mechanism we use to call Erlang modules

    iex> :lists.flatten([1, [2], 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    
# require
Elixir provides macros as a mechanism for meta-programming (writing code that generates code). Macros are expanded at compile time.

Public functions in modules are globally available, but in order to use macros, you need to opt-in by requiring the module they are defined in.

    iex> Integer.is_odd(3)
    ** (CompileError) iex:1: you must require Integer before invoking the macro Integer.is_odd/1
        (elixir) src/elixir_dispatch.erl:97: :elixir_dispatch.dispatch_require/6
    iex> require Integer
    Integer
    iex> Integer.is_odd(3)
    true
In Elixir, Integer.is_odd/1 is defined as a macro so that it can be used as a guard. 

# import
We use import whenever we want to access functions or macros from other modules without using the fully-qualified name. 

    # We imported only the function duplicate (with arity 2) from List. :except could also be given as an option
    iex> import List, only: [duplicate: 2]
    List
    iex> duplicate(:ok, 3)
    [:ok, :ok, :ok]

import is lexically scoped too. 

    defmodule Math do
        # the imported List.duplicate/2 is only visible within that specific function.
        def some_function do
            import List, only: [duplicate: 2]
            duplicate(:ok, 10)
        end
    end
Note that imports are generally discouraged in the language. When working on your own code, prefer alias to import.

# use
The use macro is frequently used as an extension point. 
This means that, when you use a module FooBar, you allow that module to inject any code in the current module, such as importing itself or other modules, defining new functions, setting a module state, etc.

    defmodule AssertionTest do
        use ExUnit.Case, async: true

        test "always pass" do
            assert true
        end
    end
use requires the given module and then calls the __using__/1 callback on it allowing the module to inject some code into the current context. 

    defmodule Example do
        use Feature, option: :value
    end
    
    # is compiled into
    defmodule Example do
        require Feature
        Feature.__using__(option: :value)
    end
Since use allows any code to run, Don’t use use where an import or alias would do.

# Module nesting

    #  define two modules: Foo and Foo.Bar
    defmodule Foo do
        defmodule Bar do
        end
    end
If, later, the Bar module is moved outside the Foo module definition, it must be referenced by its full name (Foo.Bar) or an alias must be set using the alias directive discussed above.
    
    defmodule Foo.Bar do
    end

    defmodule Foo do
        alias Foo.Bar
        # Can still access it as `Bar`
    end
    
# Multi alias/import/require/use
alias the modules MyApp.Foo, MyApp.Bar and MyApp.Baz at once

    alias MyApp.{Foo, Bar, Baz}
