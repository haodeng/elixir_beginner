# Binaries, strings, and charlists
In Elixir you can use a ? in front of a character literal to reveal its code point:

    iex> ?a
    97
    iex> ?ł
    322
    
we can represent any Unicode character in an Elixir string by using the \u notation and the hex representation of its code point number:

    iex> "\u0061" === "a"
    true
    iex> 0x0061 = 97 = ?a
    97
    
Elixir uses UTF-8 to encode its strings, which means that code points are encoded as a series of 8-bit bytes. 
UTF-8 is a variable width character encoding that uses one to four bytes to store each code point; 
it is capable of encoding all valid Unicode code points.

    iex> string = "hełło"
    "hełło"
    iex> String.length(string)
    5
    iex> byte_size(string)
    7
String.length/1 counts graphemes, but byte_size/1 reveals the number of underlying raw bytes needed to store the string when using UTF-8 encoding. 
UTF-8 requires one byte to represent the characters h, e, and o, but two bytes to represent ł.

A common trick in Elixir when you want to see the inner binary representation of a string is to concatenate the null byte <<0>> to it:

    iex> "hełło" <> <<0>>
    <<104, 101, 197, 130, 197, 130, 111, 0>>
Alternatively, you can view a string’s binary representation by using IO.inspect/2:

    iex> IO.inspect("hełło", binaries: :as_binaries)
    <<104, 101, 197, 130, 197, 130, 111>>
