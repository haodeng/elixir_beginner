# Keyword lists
In Elixir, when we have a list of tuples and the first item of the tuple (i.e. the key) is an atom, we call it a keyword list

    iex> list = [{:a, 1}, {:b, 2}]
    [a: 1, b: 2]
    # Elixir supports a special syntax for defining such lists: [key: value]
    iex> list == [a: 1, b: 2]
    true

Since keyword lists are lists, we can use all operations available to lists. 

    iex> list ++ [c: 3]
    [a: 1, b: 2, c: 3]
    iex> [a: 0] ++ list
    [a: 0, a: 1, b: 2]
Note that values added to the front are the ones fetched on lookup

    iex> new_list = [a: 0] ++ list
    [a: 0, a: 1, b: 2]
    iex> new_list[:a]
    0

Keyword lists are important because they have three special characteristics:

* Keys must be atoms.
* Keys are ordered, as specified by the developer.
* Keys can be given more than once.

# Maps
Whenever you need a key-value store, maps are the “go to” data structure in Elixir. A map is created using the %{} syntax:

    iex> map = %{:a => 1, 2 => :b}
    %{2 => :b, :a => 1}
    iex> map[:a]
    1
    iex> map[2]
    :b
    iex> map[:c]
    nil
Compared to keyword lists, we can already see two differences:

* Maps allow any value as a key.
* Maps’ keys do not follow any ordering.
