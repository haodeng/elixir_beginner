Elixir has three error mechanisms: errors, throws, and exits

# Errors
Errors (or exceptions) are used when exceptional things happen in the code

    iex> :foo + 1
    ** (ArithmeticError) bad argument in arithmetic expression
        :erlang.+(:foo, 1)
        
A runtime error can be raised

    iex> raise "oops"
    ** (RuntimeError) oops
