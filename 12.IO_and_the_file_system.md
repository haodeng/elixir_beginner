# IO and the file system
## The IO module
By default, functions in the IO module read from the standard input and write to the standard output.

    iex> IO.puts("hello world")
    hello world
    :ok
    iex> IO.gets("yes or no? ")
    yes or no? yes
    "yes\n"
    
    # :stderr as an argument (in order to write to the standard error device)
    iex> IO.puts(:stderr, "hello world")
    hello world
    :ok

## The File module
By default, files are opened in binary mode, which requires developers to use the specific IO.binread/2 and IO.binwrite/2 functions from the IO module

    iex> {:ok, file} = File.open("hello", [:write])
    {:ok, #PID<0.47.0>}
    iex> IO.binwrite(file, "world")
    :ok
    iex> File.close(file)
    :ok
    iex> File.read("hello")
    {:ok, "world"}
A file can also be opened with :utf8 encoding

the File module have two variants: one “regular” variant and another variant with a trailing bang (!).

    iex> File.read("hello")
    {:ok, "world"}
    iex> File.read!("hello")
    "world"
    iex> File.read("unknown")
    {:error, :enoent}
    
    # the version with ! returns the contents of the file instead of a tuple, 
    # and if anything goes wrong the function raises an error.
    iex> File.read!("unknown")
    ** (File.Error) could not read file "unknown": no such file or directory
    
The version without ! is preferred when you want to handle different outcomes using pattern matching

    case File.read(file) do
        {:ok, body}      -> # do something with the `body`
        {:error, reason} -> # handle the error caused by `reason`
    end
However, if you expect the file to be there, the bang variation is more useful as it raises a meaningful error message. Avoid writing:

    # Wrong. 
    # in case of an error, File.read/1 will return {:error, reason} and the pattern matching will fail. 
    {:ok, body} = File.read(file)
if you don’t want to handle the error outcomes, prefer using File.read!/1

## The Path module
the Path module takes care of different operating systems transparently. 
Finally, keep in mind that Elixir will automatically convert slashes (/) into backslashes (\) on Windows when performing file operations.

    iex> Path.join("foo", "bar")
    "foo/bar"
    iex> Path.expand("~/hello")
    "/Users/jose/hello"
