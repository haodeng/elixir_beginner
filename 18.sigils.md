Sigils start with the tilde (~) character which is followed by a letter (which identifies the sigil) and then a delimiter; 
optionally, modifiers can be added after the final delimiter.

# Regular expressions
The most common sigil in Elixir is ~r, which is used to create regular expressions:

    # A regular expression that matches strings which contain "foo" or "bar":
    iex> regex = ~r/foo|bar/
    ~r/foo|bar/
    iex> "foo" =~ regex
    true
    iex> "bat" =~ regex
    false
Regexes also support modifiers. For example, the i modifier makes a regular expression case insensitive:

    iex> "HELLO" =~ ~r/hello/
    false
    iex> "HELLO" =~ ~r/hello/i
    true

sigils support 8 different delimiters:
* ~r/hello/
* ~r|hello|
* ~r"hello"
* ~r'hello'
* ~r(hello)
* ~r[hello]
* ~r{hello}
* ~r<hello>

The reason behind supporting different delimiters is to provide a way to write literals without escaped delimiters. 
For example, a regular expression with forward slashes like ~r(^https?://) reads arguably better than ~r/^https?:\/\//. 

# Strings
The ~s sigil is used to generate strings, like double quotes are. The ~s sigil is useful when a string contains double quotes:
    
    iex> ~s(this is a string with "double" quotes, not 'single' ones)
    "this is a string with \"double\" quotes, not 'single' ones"
