Elixir provides +, -, *, / as arithmetic operators, plus the functions div/2 and rem/2 for integer division and remainder.

Elixir also provides ++ and -- to manipulate lists:

    iex> [1, 2, 3] ++ [4, 5, 6]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    iex> [1, 2, 3] -- [2]
    [1, 3]

String concatenation is done with <>:

    iex> "foo" <> "bar"
    "foobar"

Elixir also provides three boolean operators: or, and and not.
These operators are strict in the sense that they expect something that evaluates to a boolean (true or false) as their first argument

    iex> true and true
    true
    iex> false or is_atom(:example)
    true
    iex> not true
    false
    iex> 1 and true
    ** (BadBooleanError) expected a boolean on left-side of "and", got: 1
    
Besides these boolean operators, Elixir also provides ||, && and ! which accept arguments of any type. 
For these operators, all values except false and nil will evaluate to true

    # or
    iex> 1 || true
    1
    iex> false || 11
    11

    # and
    iex> nil && 13
    nil
    iex> true && 17
    17

    # not
    iex> !true
    false
    iex> !1
    false
    iex> !nil
    true
    
As a rule of thumb, use and, or and not when you are expecting booleans. If any of the arguments are non-boolean, use &&, || and !.

Elixir also provides ==, !=, ===, !==, <=, >=, < and > as comparison operators:

    iex> 1 == 1
    true
    iex> 1 != 2
    true
    iex> 1 < 2
    true
    
The difference between == and === is that the latter is more strict when comparing integers and floats:

    iex> 1 == 1.0
    true
    iex> 1 === 1.0
    false
    
In Elixir, we can compare two different data types:

    iex> 1 < :atom
    true
    
The reason we can compare different data types is pragmatism. Sorting algorithms donâ€™t need to worry about different data types in order to sort. The overall sorting order is defined below:

number < atom < reference < function < port < pid < tuple < map < list < bitstring
