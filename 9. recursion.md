# Recursion
Due to immutability, loops in Elixir (as in any functional programming language) are written differently from imperative languages. 
data structures in Elixir are immutable. For this reason, functional languages rely on recursion: a function is called recursively until a condition is reached that stops the recursive action from continuing. 
No data is mutated in this process. 

    defmodule Recursion do
      # use this definition if and only if n is less than or equal to 1
      def print_multiple_times(msg, n) when n <= 1 do
        IO.puts msg
      end

      
      # no guard 
      def print_multiple_times(msg, n) do
        IO.puts msg
        print_multiple_times(msg, n - 1)
      end
    end

    Recursion.print_multiple_times("Hello!", 3)
    # Hello!
    # Hello!
    # Hello!
Similar to case, a function may have many clauses. 
A particular clause is executed when the arguments passed to the function match the clause’s argument patterns and its guards evaluate to true

## Reduce and map algorithms
The process of taking a list and reducing it down to one value is known as a reduce algorithm and is central to functional programming.

    defmodule Math do
      def sum_list([head | tail], accumulator) do
        sum_list(tail, head + accumulator)
      end

      def sum_list([], accumulator) do
        accumulator
      end
    end

    IO.puts Math.sum_list([1, 2, 3], 0) #=> 6
    
The process of taking a list and mapping over it is known as a map algorithm.

    defmodule Math do
      def double_each([head | tail]) do
        [head * 2 | double_each(tail)]
      end

      def double_each([]) do
        []
      end
    end
    Math.double_each([1, 2, 3]) #=> [2, 4, 6]
    
The Enum module, which we’re going to see in the next chapter, already provides many conveniences for working with lists. 

    iex> Enum.reduce([1, 2, 3], 0, fn(x, acc) -> x + acc end)
    6
    iex> Enum.map([1, 2, 3], fn(x) -> x * 2 end)
    [2, 4, 6]
    
Or, using the capture syntax:

    iex> Enum.reduce([1, 2, 3], 0, &+/2)
    6
    iex> Enum.map([1, 2, 3], &(&1 * 2))
    [2, 4, 6]
